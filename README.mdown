# Daily

## Setup

Server installations needed:
* rvm
* some rvm ruby (ree)

To deploy the app, I'm using the copy capistrano method to prevent github keys being needed.

    bundle exec cap production deploy:setup

Then, I put my version of daily.yml in the /app/path/shared directory.

    bundle exec cap production deploy:cold
    bundle exec cap production deploy:migrations
    bundle exec cap production seed:admin

Which makes the first user
* email: admin@example.com
* password: changeme
